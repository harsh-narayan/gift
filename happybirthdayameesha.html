                Letter of Confession
            </div>

            <div class="letter">
                i cheated on you. and in my defence i was horny and you live 162km away. i know what you’re thinking and i get it. it’s
                common to think that. so i will answer you. yes, she was hotter than you. and no, i don’t have any regrets. i hope
                you’re okay with this. but if you are not i don’t care.
                anyway here’s some more confessions lined up. like it took me a month to build this site and if you don’t like it i will
                cry for 10 nights straight. like i had given up on the idea of ‘willing to live’ but then you came into my life. like if
                i, now, think about my past love life that once tore my heart apart, it gives me relief because everything i ever faced
                in this life lead me to you. and i did not like Rem that much (plis don’t kill me). i mean he’s good and i liked the
                songs but i probably won’t play it again for myself. and your memory power is shit. and i enjoyed slapping(gently) you
                on 13th when we ate momos. and i think about you naked almost all the time. (i think about you being naked/i think about
                you while im naked) and i actually liked your white jeans i didn’t admit at first because i was mad at you. this one
                time when we were arguing i said sorry sarcastically to make you feel bad about arguing. and it worked. IT WAS ONE TIME
                FUCK OFF. i feel like posting your story everyday because i want to flex about you everyday. i really enjoy sexting w
                you, it’s beeen weeeeeeeks. remember when we binged scoopwhoop curated old songs and then we talked about birthday’s and
                you said ‘itni pehle se kaun sochta hai’ and i chuckled and you said ‘TUNE SOCHA HUA HAI??’ and i denied. it was a lie.
                i have been planning for this for so long i don’t even remember. altho the execution only started like a month ago.
                <br><br>
                i am missing the touch of your THICK ass against my hand.<br>

                okay so rules are pretty simple. i apologise, you forgive me by giving me a blowjob. one bj for every apology. <br>
                i am sorry i can be a pain in the ass. and mostly it’s not anal. i apologise for not being the best. for committing
                mistakes. for keeping you worried sometimes. for not kissing you enough on 13 feb. for being a pussy when that guy
                ohoo-ed us when we were smoking behind the mall. sorry for using a female organ to denote cowardice in the last
                sentence.
                sorry for doubting you, for lashing out when i am angry. for spamming your insta when you’re inactive for days. for
                being rude. for being inexplicably hot and almost matching upto your league.
                <br>
                that is all the apologies. i really tried to increase my number of blowjobs here but i am hardly wrong yk.

                well this one’s gonna be a tough one. where do i even begin.
                i will never understand how simply can a emotion so vast and complex, so pure and out of the world be contain in three
                words. but i guess that is the closest i can scale my love for you in words. i love you. i love your smile. i love your
                teeth. your pointy canines. i love the scar on your forehead and your thigh. i love the moles on you finger and knuckle
                and your back. i love your curves and edges. i love your colorbone and texture of your skin. i love your deformed
                fingers. the bulge on your scalp. the knocked knees. your nose and your minimalist eyelashes. your eyebrows your chin.
                and your eyes. the hue and structure of your eyes. there are some more things about your body that i love but i am
                probably going to send this site to our friends too so hehe.
                i love your aesthetics. your choices. your beliefs. your anger. your soft heart and your witty brain. i love your
                thalassemia. your cooking skills. your humour. your art. your dedication. your issues. i love your ideas. i love how you
                help me. how you take care of your mom. how you face problems. how you find happiness. how you live. <br> this life feels
                like privilege ever since you walked in. i love your friendship. and i love your love.
